this was my source for dictionary  
https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words/blob/master/sgb-words.txt
thank you for all the words :)  
  
changed to a different set of words only 5757 instead of 23k+  
  
will create a single string of all these words instead of reading a seperate file  
doing this will take advantage of using regular expression  
  
  
if you want to try out the dictionary5letter you will have to change the input and output file path  
the input file can be downloaded from link above and set output file path to file location  
create empty txt file and set the path in dictionary5letter
